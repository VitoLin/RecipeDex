		<h3>Describe the labor division among group members.</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Vito - cleaning up the datasets to be inputted into MySQL</li>
			<li>Coleen - backend</li>
			<li>Austin - mostly front end (HTML, CSS, Javascript)</li>
			<li>Sam - Backend and front end data processing</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>A project timeline with milestones.</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Now until break - mostly focus on getting datasets cleaned and
				onto MySQL, learn about the tools we will use in our final
				project (bootstrap, apache, and php). Also research ways to
				store recipe information in an optimal way
			</li>
			<li>
				October 16th - Have base dataset entered into MySQL, recipe set
				from kaggle focusing on recipes and not so much ingredients
			</li>
			<li>
				October 17-18th - basic backend functions with insertion,
				deletion, and basic search functions created
			</li>
			<li>
				October 19th -22nd - front end created without much styling and
				interfacing with simple backend
			</li>
			<li>
				October 23rd-29th - Hammering out errors and bugs for Initial
				Demo
			</li>
			<li>
				November 1st -30th - Work on advanced functions, making the
				website look better with bootstrap and styling, debugging and
				improving on the initial demo
			</li>
			<li>December 1st - Due Date - debugging and testing</li>
