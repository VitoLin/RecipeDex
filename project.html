		<h1>RecipeDex</h1>
		<h3>Summary</h3>

		Recipe database that combines data from popular recipe websites with the
		main benefits being able filter by ingredients, get nutrition
		information, and log what you ate. We also want to allow the user to
		personalize their experience by being able to track their favorite
		recipes, get recommendations, and track their daily nutrition.

		<h3>Usefulness</h3>

		This website is useful since it combines features from multiple already
		popular applications and websites like allrecipes for the vast database
		of quality recipes and myfitnesspal for the ability to easily track your
		daily nutrition. This website will focus on improving on what already
		exists and combining together useful tools that exist separately on
		different sites and applications. This website will be extremely useful
		for those who are looking for new recipes that are both delicious and
		fits their macronutrient requirements and helps bridge the gap between
		tasty and healthy.

		<h3>Data</h3>

		Our data would be recipes: the ingredients, the directions, and any user
		information that could be relevant. There are databases that contain a
		lot of recipes and we can also scrape similar recipe websites to get
		them as well. Alongside the recipe information, we will also gather
		nutrition information in order to calculate the nutrition information
		for the recipe. This will consist of the ingredient, a set amount, and
		the nutrition information for that amount of the ingredient.

		<h3>Functions</h3>

		Our simple functions will include search for recipes that will search by
		name, ingredients in it (either includes only the available ingredients
		or can search for recipes with the desired ingredients), or can search
		by nutrition information. Add recipes to the website, mostly by us
		instead of an arbitrary user. Users can add recipes to a “favorites”
		list for later viewing alongside removing recipes from their “favorites”
		list. We will also be making it so we can remove a recipe from the
		website in case of duplicate recipes.

		<h3>Advanced Functions</h3>

		We will provide a list of suggested recipes based off of what the user
		has favorited. This will use some algorithm to determine which recipes
		the user may like based on their history. We will also calculate
		nutrition information for websites where it is not provided as this is
		something we haven’t really seen on any recipe websites that are not
		already geared towards a healthy lifestyle.

		<h3>Why it's Cool</h3>

		It is important to have the “suggestion” feature because many popular
		food/delivery/nutrition apps do not provide suggestions based on the
		user’s previous food selections. This feature will allow the user to
		have a wider variety of food options while not having to actively search
		for new recipes.
		<br />
		Calculating the nutritional value when it is not provided for recipes
		will be helpful for the user because it will allow them to better keep
		track of their meals and understand what they are eating. This will also
		help people stick to their fitness goals while eating good food as most
		bodybuilders and athletes end up eating standard meals with simple
		ingredients since it is hard to keep track of every calorie in
		complicated recipes.
